> I hope to gain more insight about machine learning and figure out if this is a carear path I want to dedicate myself to 

**Day 2**
> 1) Supervised learning is giving a machine specififed data with definite conclusions in order to have the machine learn from the data given. Unsupervised learning is when you give a machine data that has no "key" which requires it to learn and make conslusions on its own.
> 2) Scikit-learn is Not a visualization library. It can be used in tandem with viz libs but it was not coded to perform visualizations on its own.

**Day 3**
> 1) Tensors are used as a mathematical object to convey as many dimensions as needed in a machine learning project. When creating very models like self driving cars, tensors are required because there comes a point where the data you process is so complex, there's no way for a computer to understand it without many different dimensions of that data. You can use 5th dimensional tensors just for a simple colored video! (Imagine in 20 years what machines will be able to do with data that isn't just a video but real space) For 3d, 4d, & 5d tensors (time series, images, video respectively) we see many different usabilties. Since time series data is a form of tensor, we can make prediction models just like Quants at a big bank do. For 4d tensors we've got the typical GANs, image recognition, the basis of self-driving cars, etc. 5d gets cool because you'll be able to process video feed and figure out whatever you want. You can use it as mask detection, figuring out if you're about to get in a car crash, or maybe see how fast a baseball is moving and predict where itll go. One main feature is its able to store data systematically along with keeping structure throughout. Very Interesting!! (Took a minute to undertsand it all but very worth it)
> 2) All the outputs were in tensor form. An image wasnt an image, it was a set of numbers.
